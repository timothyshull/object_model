# Understanding C++ Using the AST and the Object Model
This repo contains the example code for the corresponding Bay Area ACCU
talk. The majority of the examples and the general outline for the
project is based on Stanley Lippman's "Inside the C++ Object Model",
with additional resources drawn from cppreference.com and Anthony
Williams' "C++ Concurrency in Action". The main purpose of this
project is to use Hopper (https://www.hopperapp.com/) and various
features of clang to expose some of the underlying functionality that
facilitates the object model in C++.

The profiling sub-project is dependent on Google benchmark (https://github.com/google/benchmark).

Run `./build.sh -b` in the root directory of the project to add this dependency.

Run `./build.sh` in the root directory of the project for automated file generation and
project setup options.

This project is currently under construction.
